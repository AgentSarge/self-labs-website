          Look, I get it - when you're running a business in Monroe, you're busy. You're dealing with customers, managing inventory, handling payroll. The last thing you want to think about is your website. But here's the thing - your website is often the first impression customers have of your business.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I've seen too many Monroe businesses struggle with websites that don't work. Sites that are slow, hard to navigate, or just plain invisible on Google. That's why I want to share these success stories - to show you what's possible when you get your website right.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Downtown Monroe Restaurant: 200% Increase in Online Orders</h2>
        
        <div class="bg-white/5 p-6 rounded-lg border border-white/10 mb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">The Challenge</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Sarah's restaurant downtown was struggling. Great food, loyal customers, but their website was a disaster. Customers couldn't find their menu online, couldn't place orders, and Google couldn't find them when people searched for "restaurant Monroe GA."
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">
            "We were losing customers to chain restaurants that had better online presence," Sarah told me. "People would call asking if we had a website, and we'd have to say 'sort of.'"
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white/5 p-6 rounded-lg border border-white/10 mb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">What We Did</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-300">
            <li>• <strong>Mobile-first design</strong> - Most people search for restaurants on their phones</li>
            <li>• <strong>Online ordering system</strong> - Easy to use, integrated with their POS</li>
            <li>• <strong>Local SEO optimization</strong> - Targeted "restaurant Monroe GA" and related keywords</li>
            <li>• <strong>Google My Business setup</strong> - Complete profile with photos, hours, menu</li>
            <li>• <strong>Speed optimization</strong> - Fast loading, no more frustrated customers</li>

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Within 3 months, Sarah's restaurant saw a 200% increase in online orders. They went from being invisible on Google to ranking #1 for "restaurant Monroe GA" and related searches.

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            "It's been incredible," Sarah said. "We're getting orders from people who've never been to our restaurant before. They find us online, see our menu, and place an order. It's like having a whole new revenue stream."
