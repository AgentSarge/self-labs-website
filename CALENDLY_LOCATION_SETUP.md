## üè¢ Setting Up Location Selection (Without Revealing Your Address)

You want clients to suggest a meeting location (Starbucks, Dunkin, etc.) without showing your home address. Here's how:

### Option 1: Add a Custom Question (Recommended - Easiest)

This lets clients suggest a location in Monroe, GA or nearby:

1. **Go to your Calendly event**:
   - Open: https://calendly.com/event_types/user/me
   - Click on **"New Meeting"** event
   - Click **Edit**

2. **Add a custom question**:
   - Scroll to **"Invitee Questions"** section
   - Click **"Add Question"**
   - Question type: **"One line text"** or **"Multiple lines"**
   - Question text: **"Where would you like to meet? (Suggest a coffee shop or location convenient for you in or near Monroe, GA)"**
   - Make it **Required**
   - Click **Save**

3. **Set location as "Ask invitee"**:
   - In the event settings, find **"Location"** section
   - Select **"Ask invitee"**
   - Or select **"Invitee's location"**
   - This way you coordinate location via the custom question

**Example question text:**
```
Where would you like to meet?

Please suggest a convenient location like:
- Starbucks
- Dunkin' Donuts
- Local coffee shop
- Other public place

(In or near Monroe, GA area)
```

### Option 2: Use Multiple Location Options

Give them preset choices without revealing your exact address:

1. **Go to event settings ‚Üí Location**
2. **Select "Location options"**
3. **Add multiple locations**:
   - "Coffee shop to be determined (Monroe, GA area)"
   - "Starbucks in Monroe area - specific location TBD"
   - "Dunkin' Donuts in Monroe area - specific location TBD"
   - "Phone call as backup"

4. **They select one**, then you coordinate the exact spot via email/phone

### Option 3: Use "Invitee Phone Location" + Custom Question

1. **Location type**: Select **"Invitee Phone Location"**
2. **Add custom question**: "What's your preferred area/city for meeting?"
3. **After booking**: You reach out to suggest specific venues
