# ChatGPT Commerce Integration Guide for Self Labs

## 🚀 What is ChatGPT Instant Checkout?

**Instant Checkout** is a revolutionary new feature (launched September 2025) that allows **700+ million ChatGPT users** to buy products and services directly inside ChatGPT conversations without leaving the chat.

This is powered by the **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** - an open standard built by OpenAI and Stripe specifically for AI commerce.

### Why This Matters for Self Labs:

- **700M+ weekly ChatGPT users** searching for services like website design
- Users can say "I need a website for my business" and buy your services **immediately**
- **No leaving ChatGPT** - seamless checkout experience
- You stay in control of orders, payments, fulfillment, and customer relationships
- **Free to be discovered** - only pay a small fee when purchases are made

---

## 📋 How It Works

### Customer Journey:

1. **User asks ChatGPT**: "I need a professional website for my business"
2. **ChatGPT recommends**: Shows your Self Labs services (based on relevance)
3. **User views details**: Sees your packages ($300 build, $50/month maintenance)
4. **User clicks "Buy"**: Inline checkout appears in ChatGPT
5. **Payment processed**: Via Stripe (Card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Link)
6. **Order confirmed**: You receive order directly, process through your system

### For Merchants (You):

- Apply as a merchant at **chatgpt.com/merchants**
- Push your service offerings to ChatGPT's catalog
- Integrate checkout API endpoints
- Process payments through Stripe
- You remain the merchant of record

### Step 2: Define Your Service Offerings

Structure your website design services as "products" for ChatGPT:

#### Service Product 1: One-Time Website Build
```json
{
  "name": "Professional Website Build",
  "description": "Custom-designed, mobile-responsive website built with modern frameworks. Includes SEO optimization, contact forms, and 30-day support.",
  "price_range": "$300 - $2,500+",
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "Basic Website",
      "price": 300,
      "description": "3-5 pages, mobile responsive, basic SEO"
    },
    {
      "name": "Standard Website", 
      "price": 800,
      "description": "5-10 pages, custom design, advanced SEO, contact forms"
    },
    {
      "name": "Premium Website",
      "price": 2500,
      "description": "10+ pages, e-commerce integration, advanced features, premium support"
    }
  ],
  "delivery_time": "1-4 weeks",
  "category": "Web Development"
}
```

#### Service Product 2: Monthly Maintenance
```json
{
  "name": "Website Maintenance Package",
  "description": "Ongoing website updates, security patches, content changes, and technical support.",
  "price_range": "$50 - $200/month",
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "Basic Maintenance",
      "price": 50,
      "billing": "monthly",
      "description": "Monthly updates, security patches, 2 content changes"
    },
    {
      "name": "Standard Maintenance",
      "price": 100,
      "billing": "monthly", 
      "description": "Weekly updates, security monitoring, 5 content changes, priority support"
    },
    {
      "name": "Premium Maintenance",
      "price": 200,
      "billing": "monthly",
      "description": "Daily monitoring, unlimited changes, 24/7 support, performance optimization"
    }
  ],
  "category": "Web Services"
}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Agentic Commerce Protocol

**Official Documentation**: https://www.agenticcommerce.dev/

**Technical Requirements**:

You need to create API endpoints that ChatGPT will call:

#### A. Product Catalog API
Endpoint to push your services to ChatGPT:

```javascript
// POST /api/catalog/sync
// Push your service offerings to ChatGPT

{
  "merchant_id": "self-labs-io",
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "website-build-basic",
      "name": "Basic Website Build",
      "description": "Professional 3-5 page website...",
      "price": 30000, // in cents
      "currency": "USD",
      "category": "web-development",
      "availability": "in_stock",
      "images": ["https://self-labs.io/images/service-website-build.jpg"],
      "metadata": {
        "delivery_time": "1-2 weeks",
        "includes": ["Mobile responsive", "SEO", "Contact form"]
      }
    }
    // ... more products
  ]
}
```

#### B. Checkout Initialization API
ChatGPT calls this when user wants to buy:

```javascript
// POST /api/checkout/initialize
// Receive order details from ChatGPT

{
  "order_id": "chatgpt_order_12345",
  "product_id": "website-build-basic",
  "quantity": 1,
  "customer": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "payment_token": "spt_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" // Shared Payment Token from Stripe
}

// Your response:
{
  "status": "success",
  "order_id": "your_internal_order_123",
  "next_steps": "We'll contact you within 24 hours to discuss requirements"
}
```

#### C. Order Status API
Let ChatGPT check order status:

```javascript
// GET /api/orders/{order_id}/status

{
  "order_id": "your_internal_order_123",
  "status": "in_progress", // pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled
  "delivery_estimate": "2025-10-30",
  "updates": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-16T10:00:00Z",
      "message": "Project kickoff call scheduled"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Integrate Stripe Payment Processing

**Using Shared Payment Tokens (SPT)**:

```javascript
// When you receive an order from ChatGPT:

const stripe = require('stripe')('your_stripe_secret_key');

async function processOrderPayment(orderData) {
  try {
    // ChatGPT provides a Shared Payment Token (SPT)
    const spt = orderData.payment_token;
    
    // Create a payment intent using the SPT
    const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
      amount: orderData.amount,
      currency: 'usd',
      payment_method: spt,
      confirm: true,
      description: `Self Labs - ${orderData.product_name}`,
      metadata: {
        order_id: orderData.order_id,
        customer_email: orderData.customer.email
      }
    });
    
    if (paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {
      // Payment successful - fulfill order
      await createOrder(orderData);
      await sendConfirmationEmail(orderData.customer.email);
      return { success: true, order_id: orderData.order_id };
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Payment failed:', error);
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Build Your Integration

**Technology Stack Options**:

#### Option 1: Simple API (Recommended for MVP)
```
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Payment: Stripe SDK
- Hosting: Netlify Functions or Vercel
```

#### Option 2: Full Integration
```
- Backend: Same as your Astro site (could add API routes)
- Use Astro API endpoints
- Integrate with existing infrastructure
```

**Minimal Example** (using Astro API routes):

```javascript
// /src/pages/api/chatgpt/products.json.ts
export async function GET() {
  const products = [
    {
      id: 'basic-website',
      name: 'Basic Website Build',
      price: 30000, // $300 in cents
      description: 'Professional 3-5 page website',
      // ... more fields
    }
  ];
  
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ products }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
}

// /src/pages/api/chatgpt/checkout.json.ts
export async function POST({ request }) {
  const orderData = await request.json();
  
  // Process with Stripe
  // Create order in your system
  // Send notifications
  
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ 
    success: true,
    order_id: 'new_order_id' 
  }));
}
```

## 🎯 Ranking & Discovery

### How Products Are Ranked in ChatGPT:

**Product Search Results** (when user searches):

Your service descriptions should include:
- ✅ Clear, detailed descriptions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Current Limitations:

- **Service payments** may have different considerations than physical products
- **Rolling approvals** - not all merchants approved immediately

### Service-Specific Considerations:
- Website design is a **custom service** (not a standard product)
- May need to clarify scope/requirements after purchase
- Consider offering "consultation" as a low-cost entry product
- Build trust through clear communication and portfolio

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track

Once integrated, monitor:
- **Discovery rate**: How often you appear in ChatGPT results
- **Click-through rate**: Users viewing your services
- **Conversion rate**: Purchases vs. views
